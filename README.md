## About My First Blog

The idea behind this repo is to learn to create my first blog with the Framework Laravel. The thing is that I'm a newbie in it. I know a bit of PHP, HTML and CSS combine, but i'm not sure that I understand well OPP or MVC stuff, well, I get it but not easy to understand for me right now ...

- Simple and minimalist theme
- List of Articles
- Maybe a Comment section owow
- Administration Panel to deal with my Articles

## Learning Github

The thing is that I don't know how to git some stuffs and how to deal with Github as well. I know this is important so ... that's why I'm here buddy.
